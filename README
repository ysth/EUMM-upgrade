    If you need to declare number spaces in indent in Makefile.PL, use
    following string at start of it (set 'c-basic-offset' to your value):

    # -*- mode: perl; c-basic-offset: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil; -*-

    App::EUMM::Upgrade

    eumm-upgrade is a tool to allow using new features of
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker without losing compatibility with older versions. It
    adds compatibility code to Makefile.PL and tries to automatically detect
    some properties like license, minimum Perl version required and
    repository used.
